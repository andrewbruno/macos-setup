# MacOs Setup

Everytime I get a new Mac, or a collegue starts, there are some fundamental tools and hints I like to share in order to make the setup process seemless.

These are some of the tools and apps that are recommended:

1. [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)

Most developers spend their time on the console / terminal.  MacOs already offers a default Terminal, however I personally find iTerm more prowerful.

2. [sdkman.io](https://sdkman.io/install)

Excellent for installing Java (and easily managing the different versions) - plus many other SDKs like gradle, groovy, maven etc.  For example:

```
sdk install gradle
sdk install java 8.0.212-zulu
```

3. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

Sublime is a very lightweight text editor, that many have used for coding.  Today, I use Visual Code and IntelliJ for 90% of my code development, but there are many times I need a quick lihght weight text editor to just write some notes, or remove some formatting.

4. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Great for web development, front end, ReactJS and GoLang to name a few.

5. [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Great for Java, Groovy, Kotlin code bases.
